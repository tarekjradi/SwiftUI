### Creating and Combining Views

Uses stacks to combine and layer the image and text view components. To add a map to the view, you’ll include a standard MapKit component. As you refine the view’s design, Xcode provides real-time feedback so you can see how those changes translate into code

### Building Lists and Navigation

With the basic landmark detail view set up, you need to provide a way for users to see the full list of landmarks, and to view the details about each location.

You’ll create views that can show information about any landmark, and dynamically generate a scrolling list that a user can tap to see a detail view for a landmark. To fine-tune the UI, you’ll use Xcode’s canvas to render multiple previews at different device sizes.

### Handling User Input

In the Landmarks app, a user can flag their favorite places, and filter the list to show just their favorites. To create this feature, you’ll start by adding a switch to the list so users can focus on just their favorites, and then you’ll add a star-shaped button that a user taps to flag a landmark as a favorite.
