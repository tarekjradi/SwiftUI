### Creating and Combining Views

Uses stacks to combine and layer the image and text view components. To add a map to the view, you’ll include a standard MapKit component. As you refine the view’s design, Xcode provides real-time feedback so you can see how those changes translate into code

### Building Lists and Navigation

With the basic landmark detail view set up, you need to provide a way for users to see the full list of landmarks, and to view the details about each location.

You’ll create views that can show information about any landmark, and dynamically generate a scrolling list that a user can tap to see a detail view for a landmark. To fine-tune the UI, you’ll use Xcode’s canvas to render multiple previews at different device sizes.

### Handling User Input

In the Landmarks app, a user can flag their favorite places, and filter the list to show just their favorites. To create this feature, you’ll start by adding a switch to the list so users can focus on just their favorites, and then you’ll add a star-shaped button that a user taps to flag a landmark as a favorite.

# Drawing and Animations

### Drawing Paths and Shapes

Users receive a badge whenever they visit a landmark in their list. Of course, for a user to receive a badge, you’ll need to create one. This tutorial takes you through the process of creating a badge by combining paths and shapes, which you then overlay with another shape that represents the location.

If you want to create multiple badges for different kinds of landmarks, try experimenting with the overlaid symbol, varying the amount of repetition, or changing the various angles and scales.

### Animating Views And Transitions

When using SwiftUI, you can individually animate changes to views, or to a view’s state, no matter where the effects are. SwiftUI handles all the complexity of these combined, overlapping, and interruptible animations for you.

In this tutorial, you’ll animate a view that contains a graph for tracking the hikes a user takes while using the Landmarks app. Using the animation(_:) modifier, you’ll see just how easy it is to animate a view.

The home screen for Landmarks shows a scrolling list of categories, with horizontally scrolling landmarks within each category. As you build this primary navigation, you’ll explore how composed views can adapt to different device sizes and orientations.
